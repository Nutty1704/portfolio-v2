        Recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, I've spent the
        last few years diving deep into web development. From building my first
        "Hello World" to creating full-scale applications, I'm constantly
        learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating user
        experiences that are both functional and delightful. When I'm not
        coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies or finding new ideas for my next project.
